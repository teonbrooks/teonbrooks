# Fellow, Mozilla/Stanford
__Executive Summary__

During my 2016-2017 Mozilla Fellowship for Science, I was a national co-organizer for the inaugural [March for Science](https://marchforscience.org) in Washington, D.C., which amassed 100k advocates for Science, and for evidence-based decisions in policy-making.

During my postdoc at Stanford, I was a core-contributor to __(1)__ the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) project for the inclusion of MEG into the specification ([our paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018110)), and to __(2)__ the [MNE-BIDS](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids) project to provide a software implementation ([our paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01896)).
