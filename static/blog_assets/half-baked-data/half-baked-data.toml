## Pillow_heif Request

- Solved with [PKG add libheif, pyheif, and pillow_heif (decoder only) by ryanking13 Â· Pull Request #3161 Â· pyodide/pyodide Â· GitHub](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/3161)

It isn't a simple Python Wheels, it has some c++ bindings so it requires a full build to WASM
- requires libheif
    - requires libde265
- pillow_heif (0.6.1)
- pyheif (0.7.0)
- There is a difference in `pillow_heif` and `pyheif`. I ended up needing `pillow_heif`.
