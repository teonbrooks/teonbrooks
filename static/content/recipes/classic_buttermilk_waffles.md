Waffle Tip: Cornstarch makes the waffles crisper. If you don’t
have cornstarch, you could still make great waffles by omitting
cornstarch and increasing flour to 2 cups. Bake as directed

Buttermilk Blueberry Waffles
Pour batter onto bottom grid of waffle maker; sprinkle batter
with fresh (or defrosted frozen) blueberries. Close waffle maker
and bake as directed.
