## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, using a standing or hand mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and continue creaming, then add the tahini and incorporate.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add to the wet ingredients and mix until incorporated. Fold in the peanuts.
4. Scoop the dough into 3-ounce balls and divide between the baking sheets. Bake for 14-16 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through baking.
5. Remove from the oven and drizzle the cookies generously with tahini and a sprinkle of Maldon while still warm. Leave to cool before serving.
