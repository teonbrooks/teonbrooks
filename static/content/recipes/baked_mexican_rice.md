# Baked Mexican Rice

## Ingredients

* 4 roma tomatoes, core removed and cut into quarters
* 1 yellow or white onion, skin removed and cut into quarters
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil.
* 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced (leave the seeds in if you want extra heat)
* 1 1/2 cups reduced sodium chicken broth
* 1 Tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp salt to taste
* 1/2 cup minced fresh cilantro (divided)
* 2 green onions, sliced
* 1 lime (juiced)

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
To a blender or food processor, add tomatoes, onion and approximately 2 Tbsp of the minced cilantro.  Process until smooth.  This should yield around 2 cups, but if there's excess, discard any amount more than 2 cups.

(Two cups of jarred salsa can be substituted here. Using above will result in lighter, fluffier rice)
Add vegetable oil to a large, oven safe pan, and heat over MED heat.  Add rice and saute for about 5-10 minutes, until fragrant and lightly golden.
Add garlic and jalapeño and stir about 30 seconds or so, until fragrant.  Add tomato puree, tomato paste, chicken broth and 1 tsp salt.  Stir to combine and bring to a boil.
Cover and bake about 25-30 minutes, until liquid is absorbed, stirring halfway through.  Fluff rice with a fork, squeeze lime juice over rice and stir in cilantro and green onions.  
Taste and adjust by adding more salt or black pepper, if needed.
