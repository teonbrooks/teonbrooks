Universities to Consider
CUNY system
- CCNY (has a data science and engineering program)
- CUNY Graduate Center (PhD in data science)
- Brooklyn College
- Hunter College


Work on a research statement
- Just in case I do decide to do something academic-y again
- Focus is on word recognition as a research area
- Everything else is on methods
- MNE
    - MEG methods
    - EEG methods
    - eye-tracking
- Potential application to reading differences
- Partner with clinical colleagues
- Data science

Tie it to public-interest technology perhaps
