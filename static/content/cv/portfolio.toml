DIYSciThai was an Open Science workshop taught in Bangkok, Thailand in June 2016. 
This two-day workshop is the basis of an open science initiative to provide an 
integrative curriculum to teach cognitive science through experiential learning.

This DIY workshop featured building research electronics (eye-tracker and EEG) from open-source hardware, and low-cost electronics.

This workshop was supported by grants from Fulbright Thailand, the Open and Collaborative Science in Development Network (OCSDnet), 
and NYU.
