I was walking down the street on the way to grab a late lunch, and I see across the street that a bike accidentally bumped into a car. The driver got upset then enraged, and then he tried to run over the biker! It was one of the wildest things I have witnessed. I didn't have a fast enough reaction to record the incident but I did capture a photo of the car and the bike protesting the attempted murder by kicking the car. There was a group of bystander about 6 or so who witnessed the incident and tried to help the guy. He shared with him the video and photos of the incident that we captured and each gave him our number in case he wanted to press charges against the guy.

May 9 6:00pm CET

Joined the call to meet my batchmates, everyone is really cool.
Did some intros and we had some previous RCers on the call. They shared their experience with RC

- suggestion: pair more
- suggestion: have a few projects
- if your topic is niche or you don't have other folks from your batch is doing, then it might be hard to have build momentum around that topic
- take more advantage of the time here to really immerse in the people and the things going on during the batch

when should we be on?

core hours: 11am-5pm

Keith, looks to be in his mid-40s, salt-and-pepper braids faded on the side, glasses, jolly, a bigger-sized guy. He asked if I was going to Albuquerque for the eclipse. He pointed out that I had on my NASA shirt. I told him I was going for the hot air balloon festival but I had heard about the eclipse as well so I am thinking about it.

He told me that University of New Mexico around 9am would be holding a viewing party.

He told me that he had extra glasses and he offered me a pair.

He was going for the eclipse, also to learn more about Native American hertiage, and he was trying to get tickets to the hot air balloon festival as well.
