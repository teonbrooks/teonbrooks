# Civic Engagement

## Nonprofit

## Teaching

I am a very strong interest in public school education as well as data literacy for teaching new learners as well as for making policy decisions. I've been a volunteer with NYCares where I've taught SAT Prep to high schoolers in the city, and also math games to elementary students. I've started a nonprofit with the focus on teaching data science skills through the discipline of cognitive science, which give learners the ability to understand how data can intend us about how we act, think, and perceive things in the world. 

## Community Board

I feel a perspective on research in learning science who marry well with the education initiatives and policies within the community board.
I'm a research scientist by training and a data scientist by profession. I feel these skills would be very valuable to have when evaluating different proposals affecting our neighborhood. I'm very fresh in this level of civic engagement and I feel that this could be a very strong asset to the community board. I feel that there is a great opportunity for me both to learn more about my community and also for me to apply skills.
