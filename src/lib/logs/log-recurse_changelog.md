**First Day of Recurse!**

### Orientation

- Breakout session at the beginning
- Nervous and Excited Icebreaker where we shared what we are nervous about and what we are excited about
- RC is built around self-direction, RC is a container: provide a bit of structure but filled with programming and events from Recursers
- We covered the Three Self-directives of Recurse
- We went over the Social Rules of Recurse, which is good for expectation-setting, group norming.
- Politics is opt-in. With this approach, we give an opportunity to not engage. It isn't censorship, it's consent.
- Did some meet and greets, went from pairs to group

### What Did I Do

Today, I began setting up things to support me during RC, and simultaneously I'm seeking gain/restore balance with my mind, body, spirit:

- Found other runners in cohort
  - Unearthed old RC Strava group, now an admin
  - Personally committed myself to a running schedule (Tue, Thu, Sat)
- Made some other personal fitness/health goals
  - Reducing coffee intake: switch to decaf
  - Improve diet: fewer burgers and pizza; a large cut in carb intake. Reduce comfort food reliance.
  - Consistent physical fitness: stick to the run schedule
- Setting up some daily meditation time
- Cleaned up my workstation
- Began to set up a weekly newsletter
- Watched the Gilbert Strang's final lecture at MIT
- Did some tech reading
- Had last supper burger at PNY before new commitments start ü•≤
- üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Meditated for ten minutes before bed

## recurse-s1-w1-d2: 2023-05-15

- Recurse Run done: Parc Buttes-Chaumont
- üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Participated in group meditation session
  - I remembered reading a post from AJ Keller about brown noise.
  - Found this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w) on YouTube and it really helped me with my meditation
- Participated in a pair-programming workshop
  - Worked on building Conway's Game of Life with Aiden
  - We nearly finished before the workshop ended but kept getting a weird error we couldn't troubleshoot at first.
  - Figured out it was related to the fact that we were mutating the board while we were doing the neighbor check.
  - Got the program to work

## Outside Recurse

- Dinner with Joe N. at Pianoterra
  - Stumbled upon this restaurant and fortunately, they had a table even after the server told us no immediately when we arrived, he then checked and welcomed us to join.
  - Joe ordered a starter of "polpettes", which we both thought would be octopus, but it turned out to be meatballs. We split them and there were incredible. We put in an order for a second round of them but they were out. We got the artichoke instead. It was fine, it was stuffed with breadcrumbs, and peppers, and a bunch of other things. We both got the braised beef rigatoni and it was delicious. Had some wine and they were generous pours, halfway through the second glass, I could feel the intoxication. We each got a dessert, I got the boba soaked in limoncello. I think the liquor was a bit overpowering for the cake. The hand-whipped cream topping really helped to try to balance it out.

## recurse-s1-w1-d3: 2023-05-16

- Making some updates to my personal website
  - Adding my personal logs (language learning, pushups, recurse changelog)
  - Making a section for what-in-progress blog pieces
- Nico had to cancel lunch so I grabbed two quiche Lorraine, a sandwich jambon fromage, and a pain chocolate
  - Remembered Peter Gordon telling me about the sandwich, so simple yet elegant. They spread butter onto the baguette before adding the ham and cheese and it is SO FREAKING GOOD!
- Met with a fellow Recurser, Erika, and talked about web development and machine learning
  - I shared with her my project idea
    - She expressed that she has had a desire for something similar with journals
    - Multiple different journals
    - Imagine if we mix text with pictures with movies
    - Imagine a multimedia canvas for a given day or time period
    - One suggestion would be to have an optional song play, like with the old internet
      - Could be the song of the summer
      - Could be the song you had in your head that day
    - Snap to grid, I could make it simple to add content
    - This is reminding me of the Mozilla Hopscotch app
  - We both expressed interest in wanting to move into machine learning as either a researcher or engineer
- üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Participated in group meditation
  - The [Brown Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w) has really helped me gain more focus to meditate. Also using it for working
- Advice and Introductions
  - A bit of advice from a previous Recurser: Have both brain work and finger work
    - Things that make you think (work at the edge of your ability)
    - Things that you can do and build straightforwardly
  - Don't be afraid to say no to things or to drop things
