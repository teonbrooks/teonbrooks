## recurse-s1-w1-d1: 2023-05-15

**First Day of Recurse!**

### Orientation

- Breakout session at the beginning
- Nervous and Excited Icebreaker where we shared what we are nervous about and what we are excited about
- RC is built around self-direction, RC is a container: provide a bit of structure but filled with programming and events from Recursers
- We covered the Three Self-directives of Recurse
- We went over the Social Rules of Recurse, which is good for expectation-setting, group norming.
- Politics is opt-in. With this approach, we give an opportunity to not engage. It isn't censorship, it's consent.
- Did some meet and greets, went from pairs to group

### What Did I Do

Today, I began setting up things to support me during RC, and simultaneously I'm seeking gain/restore balance with my mind, body, spirit:

- Found other runners in cohort
  - Unearthed old RC Strava group, now an admin
  - Personally committed myself to a running schedule (Tue, Thu, Sat)
- Made some other personal fitness/health goals
  - Reducing coffee intake: switch to decaf
  - Improve diet: fewer burgers and pizza; a large cut in carb intake. Reduce comfort food reliance.
  - Consistent physical fitness: stick to the run schedule
- Setting up some daily meditation time
- Cleaned up my workstation
- Began to set up a weekly newsletter
- Watched the Gilbert Strang's final lecture at MIT
- Did some tech reading
- Had last supper burger at PNY before new commitments start ü•≤
- üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Meditated for ten minutes before bed

## recurse-s1-w1-d2: 2023-05-15

- Recurse Run done: Parc Buttes-Chaumont
- üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Participated in group meditation session
  - I remembered reading a post from AJ Keller about brown noise.
  - Found this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w) on YouTube and it really helped me with my meditation
- Participated in a pair-programming workshop
  - Worked on building Conway's Game of Life with Aiden
  - We nearly finished before the workshop ended but kept getting a weird error we couldn't troubleshoot at first.
  - Figured out it was related to the fact that we were mutating the board while we were doing the neighbor check.
  - Got the program to work

### Outside Recurse

- Dinner with Joe N. at Pianoterra
  - Stumbled upon this restaurant and fortunately, they had a table even after the server told us no immediately when we arrived, he then checked and welcomed us to join.
  - Joe ordered a starter of "polpettes", which we both thought would be octopus, but it turned out to be meatballs. We split them and there were incredible. We put in an order for a second round of them but they were out. We got the artichoke instead. It was fine, it was stuffed with breadcrumbs, and peppers, and a bunch of other things. We both got the braised beef rigatoni and it was delicious. Had some wine and they were generous pours, halfway through the second glass, I could feel the intoxication. We each got a dessert, I got the boba soaked in limoncello. I think the liquor was a bit overpowering for the cake. The hand-whipped cream topping really helped to try to balance it out.

## recurse-s1-w1-d3: 2023-05-16

- Making some updates to my personal website
  - Adding my personal logs (language learning, pushups, recurse changelog)
  - Making a section for what-in-progress blog pieces
- Nico had to cancel lunch so I grabbed two quiche Lorraine, a sandwich jambon fromage, and a pain chocolate
  - Remembered Peter Gordon telling me about the sandwich, so simple yet elegant. They spread butter onto the baguette before adding the ham and cheese and it is SO FREAKING GOOD!
- Met with a fellow Recurser, Erika, and talked about web development and machine learning
  - I shared with her my project idea
    - She expressed that she has had a desire for something similar with journals
    - Multiple different journals
    - Imagine if we mix text with pictures with movies
    - Imagine a multimedia canvas for a given day or time period
    - One suggestion would be to have an optional song play, like with the old internet
      - Could be the song of the summer
      - Could be the song you had in your head that day
    - Snap to grid, I could make it simple to add content
    - This is reminding me of the Mozilla Hopscotch app
  - We both expressed interest in wanting to move into machine learning as either a researcher or engineer
- üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Participated in group meditation
  - The [Brown Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqzGzwTY-6w) has really helped me gain more focus to meditate. Also using it for working
- Advice and Introductions
  - A bit of advice from a previous Recurser: Have both brain work and finger work
    - Things that make you think (work at the edge of your ability)
    - Things that you can do and build straightforwardly
  - Don't be afraid to say no to things or to drop things

impossible day

build an app: Tinder for Gender
Looked at Svelte Native options but didn't really see anything fruitful there
Started to consider just doing a webapp then came across this YouTube tutorial for a Tinder-style app in Flutter

- I don't know Flutter
- I guess it's time to learn Flutter for today lol

- 
## recurse-s1-w4-d5

- Meditation
- Paired with Alan and went through his [guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oyeFiGFbuR9veFcSrzejdnG6m8unwAfwt5bTh4ucXsY/comment#) to set up PyTorch on an M1 Mac
  - This involved installing mamba, which is the suped up conda reimplemented in C++ for speed and parallelism
  - We set up a conda environment for fastbook, the deep-learning course from Fast.ai
  - It didn't include jupyterlab
  - We also set up an environment `vie-gpu` for my project
  - Need to figure out why ipython is defaulting to the brew install version
    - TODO: Ensure that ipython can intelligently select the correct environment at start
    - TODO: Ensure the correct ipython installed
  -  Discovered even with the correct packages with correct platforms installed, Segment Anything still throws an error. MPS, which is the Metal Performance Shaders, doesn't support float64, only float32, and it seems that Segment Anything is expected float32 to work properly.
  - Found a few threads: issue [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/issues/94#), pr [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/pull/122)
