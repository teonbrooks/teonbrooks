2018 was a very busy year for me: I bounced between coasts a far bit, moved back to NYC in April, and spent a good chunk of time in Europe. A friend of mine asked me to list out all of my travel trips this year and I realized it was a good time to reflect on all the jet setting.

Here below is a list of them all, some close by and some far, and some photo highlights.
