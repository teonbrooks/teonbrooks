## Commentary

The last step of this recipes were a bit difficult and seemingly unnecessary. The recipe calls for me to brush the cookie dough with the egg mixture and then roll the log in the sugar.
There were a few problems with that. My logs got completely effed up in the freezer lol. So this didn't make for the prettiest of the shaped cylinder needed for the cookie dough. While rolling it into a log, it took me much longer than it should have to realize that I was making this log because I would be doing cross-sectional slices to create the cookie. So yes, it is important to shape the log well lol

I brushed the log but just looked a bit gross, not going to lie. The sugar didn't really latch on to the cookie. I wonder if the log was actually trying to say, "just pour some sugar on me" *cue https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UIB9Y4OFPs*

I did have to shape each cookie. I didn't have any flake salt so I used some fleur de sel I got from Guerande this summer.

I should have made the cookies a bit bigger and I should do a better job at distributing the salt instead of being a bit of a clump in on the cookie.
