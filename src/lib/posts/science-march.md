The March for Science is officially happening! On April 22, 2017, there will be a network of marches worldwide aimed to engage the community in science and support scientific research.

A few weeks ago I wrote a [post](https://teonbrooks.com/blog/few-remarks-on-the-planned-mfs/) about the planned march to advocate for the promotion of open science practices and to give voice to the concerns of underrepresented people in science. Here are a few excerpts that captures the spirit of the post:

    Science must be open. Science must be transparent. Science must be accessible.

One of the most commented topics over the past week has been about the gag orders both implemented and lifted at various federal agencies. One of the takeaway points was that information was being restricted to the public. People are outraged, and justifiably so. While we are advocating for open and transparent sharing of data from these federal agencies, we should also be advocating for the same transparency practices to research funded by taxpayer dollars.

    When diversity is set aside, diversity is not centered. Intersectionality matters.

There have been countless studies,[here](https://www.chronicle.com/article/the-invisible-labor-of-minority-professors/), [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114736), and [here](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110818/full/news.2011.485.html) for starters, that have highlighted some of the structural inequities for faculty of color in the academy from the representation to funding to institutional support. These are core issues that must be addressed if science and education continue to claim to be the great equalizer across race and socioeconomic status.

Over the past few weeks, I have been working with and have joined the National Committee for the March for Science in DC. I am co-leading the Partnership and Outreach committee, which aims to engage participations and form alliances with science organizations and the community at large.
