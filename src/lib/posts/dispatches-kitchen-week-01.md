## Commentary

This cookie is a crowd favorite! My family loves these and it is probably one of my number one requested cookie to make. It is very much a holiday/winter cookie with all the spices. When you bake these, your house will smell like Christmas.

I realized when making these that if I leave the dough in the frig overnight, the cookies are even more pronounced and flavorful. I mean, if you're in the rest and want a cookie, fine, make them. But, I realized that if I gave the cookie dough more time to marinate in all the spices, two things happen:

1. The dough is firmer and makes it easy to scoop later otherwise it can be a sticky mess

2. You really get the ginger, cloves, cinnamon, and molasses flavors working in harmony

When rolling the cookies in sugar, do not get sugar on the bottom of the cookies. I learned this the hard way. The cookie bottoms will come out a bit burnt and it will distract from the rest of the cookie. It's a tragedy to do all the work and have a subpar cookie from such a small error.
