## Commentary

This is my go-to cookie recipe. 

I always love trying recipes that come included. These companies have food scientists on staff whose whole purpose is to make their product shine. 

This recipe comes from the lid of the oatmeal and I replaced the raisins with chocolate bc I'm not a monster.
