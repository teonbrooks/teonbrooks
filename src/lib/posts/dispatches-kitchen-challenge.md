This year, I'm doing things a bit different. I have dubbed 2024 as "the Year of Stability", which means I am planning to do as little travel as possible. I do have some trips grandfathered in that I will be doing.

With this personal challenge, I decided that I will do a couple of things to make all these weeks of being in one place interesting and unique. Here I present: **The 52-Week Cookie Challenge**.

I have had this idea for a couple of years, but I hadn't really committed to it. So now I am making a public acknowledgement of this challenge to myself. So the rules are pretty straightforward:

1. A different recipe every week, no repeats.
2. It can happen any day of the week, but I am reserving Sundays for my baking day.
3. Enjoy the cookies and blog about the experience.

As I get in a groove, I might make some attempts to do some mods. Two mods in particular I am interested in:

1. One cup of flour, one egg
2. Can I make this with less sugar?

For the first one, I'm a single guy and I like to bake and sometimes I just want to have a dessert and not have like four dozen cookies staring at me. For the second one, sometimes all that sugar isn't called for. I want to understand how much is enough and in what proportion. I will also be doing some research into food science to learn more about the inner happenings of the cookie.

In addition, I would like to do some experimentation and perhaps invent some new cookies. My roommate has a copy of __The Flavor Bible__ so I might look to it for some inspiration.

Peace, love, and cookies
