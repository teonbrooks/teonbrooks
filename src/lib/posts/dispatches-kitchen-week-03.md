## Commentary

1. Always read the yield for the recipes. I hadn't realized the amount of cookie dough I was making for this recipe. THREE dozens and each cookie is 3 ounces each. Since I'm doing this weekly, my kitchen would be flooded with cookies if I kept this up. I do have another strategy for this, more on it later.
   1. A corollary to reading the yield is to read the ingredient thoroughly before grocery shopping. I bought all the ingredients but I didn't stop to think if I had enough.


The first time I baked these, I used the suggested baking time of 14-16 minutes. The cookies came out a bit dry.

I saved half the cookie dough. I baked the second batch with a cook time of 12 minutes and these cookies came out marvelous. Moist on the inside.

To be honest, this recipe seems like overkill for a cookie that still taste pretty much like an ordinary peanut butter. It does look pretty and the ingredients make it more like a gourmet dessert.
