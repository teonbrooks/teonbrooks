# Bio

Teon L. Brooks Ph.D is the director and co-founder of Computation in Education Labs ([CIEL](https://cielabs.org)). 

Dr. Brooks the completed his doctoral studies in cognition and perception at New York University's [Psychology Department](https://as.nyu.edu/psychology.html). There, he received several awards and fellowships for his research including the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (2011-2014), the French Embassy to the U.S's STEM Chateaubriand Fellowship (2014-2015). His dissertation focused on developing new techniques to understanding the brain-behavior dynamics of word recognition during reading.

Following his studies, Teon received Mozilla Fellowship (2016-2017) for Open Science where he completed his a postdoctoral work at [Stanford University](https://stanford.edu). There, his work focused on collaboration on FAIR data standards for MEG data.

Teon served as a core contributor to the MNE Project, a collection of open-source, data analysis tools for time-series, neurophysiological data (MEG/EEG/iEEG/fNIRS). This includes significant contributions to MNE-Python, MNE-BIDS, and MNE-Realtime.

Dr. Brooks has served as the technical advisor and President of [BrainWaves](https://wp.nyu.edu/brainwaves), an NIH-funded project to teach experimentation and cognitive neuroscience to high school students in NYC, and has co-founded Computation in Education Labs ([CIEL](https://cielabs.org)), a nonprofit that aims to further the mission of the BrainWaves project while focusing on data science, computational thinking, and understanding computations in both humans and machines.

Recently, Dr. Brooks led the Research and Development team at [Statespace Labs](https://statespace.gg), the makers of [Aim Lab](https://aimlab.gg), a FPS aim trainer. Prior to Statespace, Dr. Brooks worked primarily as the lead product data scientist at Mozilla.
