Relatedly, I worked with the Search product team on the Awesome Bar, our combined address bar and search product within the Firefox Browser, and researched how to improve the experience with finding things on the web.

Previously, I have worked with one of our product development teams, [Test Pilot](https://medium.com/firefox-test-pilot), to rapidly iterate on new features for the browser.
